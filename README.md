# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Aim
To build a **linear regression model** to predict house prices based on features such as:
- Number of bedrooms
- Square footage (or area)

---

## 📄 Project Description
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of linear regression to estimate housing prices using Python and Scikit-learn. The workflow involves:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Building and training the regression model
- Evaluating model performance

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning (regression modeling)  
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization

---

## 📚 What You Learn
- Fundamentals of regression analysis
- Understanding how features affect price prediction
- Data preprocessing and splitting
- Training and evaluating a machine learning model using Scikit-learn
